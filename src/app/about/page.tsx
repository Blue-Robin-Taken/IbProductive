          IB Productive is an app made with NextJS, tailwind (we try), React,
          Typescript, luck, pain, and effort. Jokes aside however, we create
          tools for IB students (mainly at Allen High School) to manage their
          workload and tasks.
          <br />
          We&aposre IB students at Allen High School. This project began with
          Xavier and Julian (the two best developers of all time totally). The
          code is totally *not* messy at all and does not look like it was
          generated by IB students with low sleep.

          Right now it&aposs only accessible to Allen High School students. If
          you would like this application to be available at your school, please
          contact us!

          We&aposre doing this for our CAS project, but we believe that
          there&aposs a genuine need for a study tool like ours for students to
          manage their time and workload.
